## Technical Details

### Database
The system uses a spreadsheet-like database implemented with JavaScript objects and localStorage. This approach allows for:
- Easy data management without requiring a server  
- Data persistence between sessions  
- Import/export functionality with CSV/Excel  

### Technologies Used
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (ES6+)  
- LocalStorage for data persistence  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Installation
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser

### Initial Setup
On first run, the system will create a sample database with:
- Demo patients  
- Sample appointments  
- Staff records  
- Billing examples  

You can clear this data and start fresh by clicking the **"Reset Database"** button in the settings.

## Usage

### Navigation
Use the sidebar menu to navigate between different modules:
- Dashboard  
- Patients  
- Appointments  
- Staff  
- Billing  
- Reports  

### Data Management
- Add new records using the **"Add"** button in each module  
- Edit records by clicking the edit icon  
- Delete records by clicking the delete icon  
- Search records using the search bar  
- Export data using the export buttons  

### Reports
1. Go to the Reports module  
2. Select the report type  
3. Choose the date range and other filters  
4. Click **"Generate Report"**  
5. View, print, or export the report  

## Data Security
All data is stored locally in your browser's localStorage. This means:
- Data doesn't leave your computer  
- No internet connection is required after initial load  
- Data persists between sessions  
- Clearing browser data will erase the database  

## Limitations
- localStorage has a size limit (usually 5â€“10MB)  
- Data is not synchronized between devices  
- Not suitable for multi-user environments without modifications  

## Future Enhancements
- Cloud synchronization  
- Multi-user support  
- Mobile application  
- Integration with medical devices  
- Prescription management  
- Inventory management
